# Proyect Horus
This is a YOLO v8 model trained to detect militry aircraft, all this in an application where the detection is made in real time, and when a detection is made, the aircraft in question is showed in the screen.

### Disclaimer
When we finished the proyect for the class, we abandoned this repository, so I do not remember what is the actual branch that holds the final changes, since we had a lot of problems the night before presenting it, so we made a LOT of changes as quickly as possible. 
Thats why the master branch (Contrary to what it should be) does not hold the latest stable version changes, or in this case, the final changes.
